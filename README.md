# Neural_Networks--Binary-classifier-on-planar-data-from_scratch-
Binary classification on planar data using a neural network with single hidden unit.performance of the model for different number of units,for different learning rates is analysed.

testcases_v2.py and planar_utils are helper programs for generating,loading datasets and for visualising models learnt.

accuracy of the model = 90 % (with 4 hidden units)

Dimensions of input matrix X =  (2, 400)
Number of training examples =  400
Dimensions of input vector =  2  Dimensional
Dimensions of input matrix Y =  (1, 400)
